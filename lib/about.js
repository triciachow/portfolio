          A final year university student at SIM (University of London). My
          passion for developing websites stems from my love for technology and
          creativity. I enjoy the challenge of taking a project brief and
          transforming it into a functional, visually appealing and
          user-friendly website. I create wireframes and prototypes with a
          user-centric approach to ensure that my design meets the criteria of
          the brief.
        </p>
        <p>
          From the planning and design phase to coding and testing, I am
          constantly learning and finding new ways to improve my skills. Seeing
          a finished website, knowing I had a hand in its creation, gives me a
          sense of pride and fulfilment.
